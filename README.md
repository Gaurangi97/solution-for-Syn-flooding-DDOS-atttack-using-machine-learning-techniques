Nowadays, network and server security takes a major place. Although firewalls are used to protect networks and servers, cyber attacks can be cited as a reason why firewalls are not more advanced. For example, most firewalls are not able to prevent a Syn flood caused by a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks. Many researchers have proposed strategies to prevent Syn flood, and their suitability is already being studied.
According to our study, we propose a new method to prevent a Syn flood. For this we use an IDS (Intrusion Detection System) in addition to a firewall. Packet filtering is done by IDS, and malicious traffic is detected by IDS. The IDS is connected with the firewall, and the firewall further analyzes malicious traffic. A special algorithm is used to determine whether the malicious traffic is caused by legal users or an attack. We are conducting research to create the algorithm, and we  follow machine learning methods for the algorithm. With this we will make an effort to successfully prevent syn flood.
